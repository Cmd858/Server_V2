# Server_V2
This project is a rewrite of a previous learning project.
I decided to make it much cleaner and better and will probably continue to update this in the future.

It uses simpleHTTPServer to process the requests (might add a threaded manager in future)
The testclient is used for testing all of the functions inside the server and draws the IP address from a .env file
